# Pepsi Spire Site (Archive)  

This repository contains a nearly-original built version of the Pepsi Spire site, which used to be located at [pepsispire.com](https://pepsispire.com).  
  
Unfortunately, not every asset was archived before the site went offline.  Those missing assets were either recreated, or left out of this repo.  
  

> Note: The assets that make up the site are from several archives over multiple years, so some information may be outdated.  
  

## Local Deployment  

As the site does not depend on any modern frameworks, and has already been built for production, any web-server than can serve an SPA should work fine for hosting.  
  

## Credits  

- [SoCuul](https://github.com/socuul) - Restoration, Debugging & Researching  
- Special thanks to the people at the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) for preserving nearly every asset of the original site. Without them, none of this would have been possible.
