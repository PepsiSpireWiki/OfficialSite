# Official Pepsi Spire Site (Archive)  

This repository contains a nearly-original archive of the official Pepsi Spire site, which used to be located at [pepsispire.com](https://pepsispire.com).  

Unfortunately, not every asset was archived before the site went offline.  Those missing assets were either recreated, or left out of this repo.  


> Note: The assets that make up the site are from several archives over multiple years, so some information may be outdated.  


## Hosting  

As the site does not depend on any modern frameworks, and has already been built for production, any web-server than can serve an SPA should work fine for hosting.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> 
> During development the URLs in `/build/script/preloader.js` must point to your development server. Eg. `SITE_URL:"http://localhost:5174"`.
>
> In production, the URLs in `/build/script/preloader.js` must to the target domain. Eg. `SITE_URL:"https://official.pepsispire.wiki"`.
